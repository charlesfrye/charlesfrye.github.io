My name is Charles Frye and I work as a Deep Learning Educator
at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site),
a San Francisco-based startup building
[developer tools for machine learning](http://wandb.me/demovideo).
I write [documentation](https://docs.wandb.com),
and [technical demos and blogposts](http://wandb.me/trace-report),
make [walkthrough videos](http://wandb.me/video-tutorials),
and contribute to product development.

I grew up in Southern Illinois, in a town called
[Kankakee](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/554/not-it),
and attended high school at the
[Illinois Math and Science Academy](https://www.imsa.edu)
in Aurora, IL, graduating in 2009.
I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology with a minor in
Computational Neuroscience at the University of Chicago in 2013.
I then did my PhD, focusing on artificial neural networks,
at UC Berkeley in the
[Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://redwood.berkeley.edu/).
My research was supported by the National Science Foundation's
[Graduate Research Fellowship](https://nsfgrfp.org).

My technical interests include
neural networks,
computational Bayesian methods,
and category theory for computer programming.
I also run tabletop roleplaying games
and read broadly,
from contemporary fiction
to early modern European history
to classics.
