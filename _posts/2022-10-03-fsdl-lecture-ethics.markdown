As part of the
[new and improved 2022 edition of Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/course/2022/),
I delivered the lecture on ethics --
in technology broadly,
in ML more narrowly,
and in the emerging field of artificial intelligence.

You can find the lecture notes on the course website
[here](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/course/2022/lecture-9-ethics).
