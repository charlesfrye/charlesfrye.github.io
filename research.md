## Neural Sampling

{:.gallery}
![sampling]

At the
[Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://redwood.berkeley.edu/),
I'm studying neural circuit implementations of sampling algorithms,
in particular the irreversible Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach of
[the Maass group](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2016.00118/full).

This research aims to uncover the ways that biological systems
take advantage of the inherent randomness of their components to achieve
efficient computation, with potential applications both
in our understanding of the brain
and in the development of new computing techniques
for emerging devices at the nanoscale.

## The Development of Spontaneous Activity

In the [laboratory of Jason MacLean](http://macleanlab.com),
I studied the development of spontaneous activity patterns
in brain slices taken from mice during the first two weeks of life.

I published my research in [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00172.2016).
In short, we discovered that spontaneous activity starts out
only recruiting very small clusters of cells, only a hundred microns across.
The activations then suddenly blossom nine days after birth
into a complicated mixture of small clusters of cells,
giant waves, and medium-sized groups of cells spread over about a millimeter.
After the mouse is two weeks old, the activity becomes more stereotyped again,
but now all of the activations are medium-sized and spread out.

This research catalogued these spontaneous patterns
at a novel scale and in brain areas that hadn't been previously studied.
Understanding the properties of these patterns is important for
understanding how the brain develops its wiring and therefore all of its functions,
including sensation, learning, and action.
Our findings corroborated other research that suggests that much of this wiring process
is innate and independent of sensory input, and further showed that the process
proceeds at the same pace in multiple areas of the brain.

## MDMA and Social Cognition in Human Subjects

As an undergraduate, I worked on an honors thesis in the
[laboratory of Harriet de Wit](http://psychiatry.bsd.uchicago.edu/hbpl/).
There, I studied the effects of MDMA, also known as "Ecstasy" or "Molly",
on the cognitive responses of human beings to simulated social rejection and acceptance.

The thesis was published in [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24316346).
We showed that research participants reported increased negative emotions,
including reduced self-esteem,
when exposed to a social rejection simulation called
["Cyberball"](https://cyberball.wikispaces.com/),
pictured above.
When the participants were given MDMA, however,
they were less saddened by the social rejection simulation
and more accurately reported the magnitude of their rejection.

This research provided useful information about the psychological mechanism
behind the effects of MDMA.
This is particularly helpful for the growing movement of physicians and scientists
who aim to [develop MDMA-assisted psychotherapy](http://www.maps.org/research/mdma?id=5374),
particularly for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Our research indicated that humans exposed to MDMA weren't simply "getting high"
and therefore becoming blunted to negative emotions,
but were actually better-equipped to perceive and deal with a minor
negative social experience.
