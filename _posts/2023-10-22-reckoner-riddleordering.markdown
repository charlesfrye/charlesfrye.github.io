Here's a Rust Riddleorder that bids the world hello:

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

Let us walk through the words of this riddleorder
step by step
and learn how it drives the reckoner to weave a greeting.

## Wordcraft ##

```rs
    fn main():
```

This is the inway of the Rust riddleorder. Runwork starts here.

The word-craft `fn` tells of a workflow, and `main` is the name of this special workflow.

`fn` is from the Frankish for workflow, _function_.

```rs
    { ... }
```
The curlholders hold the wordcraft that makes up the body of the `main` workflow.

```rs
    println!("Hello, World!");
```

This line prints the words `"Hello World!"` to the showglass.

It calls upon the `println!` inwoven-word, which is built into the Rust Groundbookstore.
The name is self-reckoning: it `print`s a `l`i`n`e.

We call upon `println!` -- or any inwoven-word or workflow -- with roundholders.
A call changes the steer of our riddleorder,
handing control to the named workflow.

## How It Unfolds ##

### Builder ###

First, the Rust builder, `rustc`, fashions the fount wordcraft of our riddleorder
into the reckoner's tongue,
doing sundry checks for kindrightness, wordstore-safety, and so forth.
These do not worry us now, for our riddleorder is so groundish.

Reck that the `c` in `rustc` is from the Frankish for builder, _compiler_.

The builder also reworks our inwoven-word, `println!`, into a normal workflow --
but we do not ever see this middle wordcraft.

`rustc` makes a runnable, which we can then run.

### Runwork ###

When we run the runnable, the reckoner's runwarden, controller of the hardware, shifts steer to the inway -- our `main` workflow.

`"Hello World!"` appears on the showglass.

```bash
Hello World!
```

## Ending ##

Our riddleorder is now done, and steer goes back to the runwarden.

For such a groundish riddleorder,
all of these works -- inwoven-words, fount wordcraft and reckoner's tongue, runwardens --
might strike as overkill.

But as you learn to weave your own riddleorders
with wendings most fine,
the might of these works will be made clear.

Good luck!
