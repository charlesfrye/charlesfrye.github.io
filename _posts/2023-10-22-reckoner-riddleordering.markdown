Here's a Rust Riddlelist that bids the world hello:

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

Let us walk through the words of this riddlelist
step by step
and come to ken how it drives the reckoner to weave a greeting.

## Wordcraft ##

```rs
    fn main():
```

This is the inway of the Rust riddlelist.
Runwork starts here.

The rune `fn` marks a workflow,
and `main` is the name of this workflow.

`fn` is from the Frankish for workflow, _function_.

```rs
    { ... }
```
The curlwrappers hold the wordcraft that
makes up the body of the `main` workflow.

```rs
    println!("Hello, World!");
```

This row of our list shows the words `"Hello World!"` on the showglass.

It calls upon the `println!` inwoven-word,
which is built into the Rust Groundbookhold.
The name is self-kenning,
to those who speak a bit of Frankish: it `print`s a `l`i`n`e.
We might name it `showrow` in our tongue.

We call upon `println!` -- or any inwoven-word or workflow -- with roundwrappers.
A call shifts the steer of our riddlelist,
handing the tiller to the called workflow.

## How It Unfolds ##

### Builder ###

First, the Rust builder, `rustc`, weaves
a riddlelist in the reckoner's tongue
out of our fount wordcraft.

Reck that the `c` in `rustc` is from the Frankish for builder, _compiler_.

As it weaves,
so also does the builder
scrutinize our riddlelist.
The forge marks kindrightness, wordhold-welfare
(Rust is a tongue that cares much for wordhold-welfare,
domain of the borrow-marker),
and so forth.

These do not worry us now,
for our riddlelist is so groundish.
But the Rust builder is a mighty friend
when riddlelists become more fiendish,
and so a Rust riddlelister learns to
reck its rede well and to heed its warnings.

The builder also reworks our inwoven-word, `println!`,
into a workflow like our `main` --
but we do not ever see this middle wordcraft.

`rustc` makes a runnable twoname,
which we can then run on our reckoner.

### Runwork ###

When we run the twoname the reckoner's runwarden,
helmsman of the hardware,
shifts steer to the inway -- our `main` workflow.

And `"Hello World!"` is shewn on the showglass!

```bash
Hello World!
```

## Ending ##

Our riddlelist is now done,
and steer goes back to the runwarden.

For such a groundish riddlelist,
all of these works -- inwoven-words, fount wordcraft and reckoner's tongue, runwardens --
might strike as overkill.

But as you learn to weave your own riddlelists
with wendings most wonderful,
the might of these works will be made open to sight.

Good luck!

## Thankings ##

The writer thanks Andy Vargas
for hunting down many Frankish words
in the first draft of this writing.
