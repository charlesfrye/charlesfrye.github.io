[Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai)
provides developer tools for machine learning --
exactly the kinds of tools I wish I'd had
while doing my PhD research.

These tools make it easier to track,
reproduce, and share ML work,
from school projects to research papers
to industrial technologies.

I just finished releasing a video series
on how to use W&B with some major deep learning libraries.
I tried to make them as fun and engaging as possible
while still packing them densely with technical info
and best practices.

Check the videos out
[here](https://wandb.me/video-tutorials).
Comment on them and let me know what you think!
