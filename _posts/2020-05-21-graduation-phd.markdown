Today, I delivered my exit talk to the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute,
which means I have officially completed the requirements for the degree
of doctory of philosophy in neuroscience!

My dissertation work was on the geometric properties
of neural network optimization problems
([arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10397)).
