Contemporary machine learning sits at the intersection
of three major branches of mathematics:
linear algebra, calculus, and probability.

Today I released the third and final video
in my Math for Machine Learning series,
which covers core intuitions needed for ML
from each of these three toolkits,
with an emphasis on the programmers' perspective.
It also includes
[interactively-graded exercises](http://wandb.me/m4ml-code).

Check the videos out
[here](https://wandb.me/m4ml-videos).
Comment on them and let me know what you think!
